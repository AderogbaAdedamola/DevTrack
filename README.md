# 🚀 Vora

> **Smart Project Tracking for Developers**

Vora is a developer-focused project management platform designed to help developers break complex projects into clear tasks, track real progress, and stay consistent from idea to completion.

Unlike many tools that grow bloated over time, Vora is built with a clear philosophy: **clarity, structure, and focus for developers**.

---

## ✨ What Vora Solves

Developers often struggle with:

* Managing large projects alone
* Losing track of progress over time
* Overcomplicated project management tools

Vora addresses these problems by providing a **clean system to plan, track, and evolve projects**, while scaling naturally as the project grows.

## 🧩 Core Features (Current & Ongoing)

### 📁 Project Management

* Create, update, and delete projects
* Each project includes:

  * Name
  * Description
  * Tasks and progress state
* Central dashboard to view all projects at a glance

### 🧱 Task Management

* Break projects into smaller, actionable tasks
* Tasks have clear states:

  * Pending
  * In Progress
  * Completed
* Progress is calculated dynamically based on task completion

### 📊 Progress Tracking

## 🧠 Backend-First Architecture

Vora is being built with a **backend from the start**.

All core data is persisted on the server — **not in localStorage** — ensuring:

* Data consistency
* Future scalability
* Multi-device access
* Secure data handling

### Backend Responsibilities

* Project and task storage
* User data and authentication (as the project evolves)
* Progress calculations
* API layer for frontend consumption
